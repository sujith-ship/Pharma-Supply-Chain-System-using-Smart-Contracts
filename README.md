The pharmaceutical industry faces significant challenges related to the security and integrity of the supply chain, including issues such as counterfeiting, diversion, and theft. These challenges can compromise patient safety, reduce the effectiveness of drugs, and cause 
financial losses for companies. In addition, traditional paper-based supply chain management systems are outdated and inefficient, increasing the likelihood of errors and delays in the supply chain. There is a need for a more secure and transparent system that can enable 
efficient tracking and tracing of drugs from the point of manufacture to the point of consumption.
